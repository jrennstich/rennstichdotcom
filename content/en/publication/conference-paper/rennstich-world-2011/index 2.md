abstract: "This paper argues that the current shifts (or crisis) in world system developmental trajectories can best be understood if they are placed in a long-term, evolutionary world-system developmental perspective. Rather than being a 'regular' iteration in this cyclical, developmental pattern, however, the current transformations are reflective of the previous collapse and following re-emergence of a complex systemic structure. This argument is tested empirically using world system network data measuring linkages between major global nodes over a 500 year period."
