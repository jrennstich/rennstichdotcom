abstract: "Nomadic agents---broadly defined as state-less actors on the state-level of analysis in a world system context---have been important drivers of global governance processes in the evolution of the world system. This paper offers a systematic typology of nomadic actors beyond the traditional historical categories and focuses on their characteristics in terms of geography, agency, and power. It extends the typology into a world system increasingly dependent on digital networks, contrasting modern forms of nomadic agents with historical configurations and draws parallels as well as highlighting differences between them. In doing so, the paper offers new insights into the governance of the modern world system in light of these comparisons, followed by a discussion of the implications for states as an organizational unit of governance in the modern world system."
