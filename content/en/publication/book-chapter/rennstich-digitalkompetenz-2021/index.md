abstract: "Informationalization and digitalization are transformative processes that require new sets of literacies, competences, and skills for active participation in and analysis of modern societies. This, however, requires changes in the methodological knowledge and thus training of students as well as teachers themselves. The ability for critical reflection of ethical challenges in combination with an extended set of knowledge about data creation, storage and codification become central issues in an increasingly complex societal structure based on digital capitalism."
