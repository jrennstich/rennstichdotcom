I participated in the [BEHAVE 2018 Agent-based Modelling summer school for Social Scientists](https://sites.google.com/view/abm-school/home) from 3--7 September 2018 in Brescia, Italy. This workshop has been offered by the team around [Flaminio Squazzoni](https://twitter.com/squazzoni?lang=en) and [Simone Gabbriellini](https://twitter.com/digitaldust_it) (big shout-out to [Nicolas Payette](https://github.com/nicolaspayette) and [Federico Bianchi](https://twitter.com/federico_fb)) with guest lectures by the incredible [Nigel Gilbert](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/people/nigel-gilbert) and [Andr√© Grow](https://twitter.com/grow_andre).

The workshop is incredibly useful, packed with hands-on coding work and theoretical material --- and the BEST food you can imagine. Highly recommended if you are interested in [learning more about ABM](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9781119954200) as a social scientist (and you should!).
