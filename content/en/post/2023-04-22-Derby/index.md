Ava and I successfully passed the Derby Test for German Short-hair Pointer hunting dogs on Saturday (22 Apr 2023) with the Klub Kurzhaar Kurhessen. III. Price. We had perfect weather and conditions. I learned so much and will be much better prepared for the next exams. I am really grateful for the support from fellow dog handlers and judges, as well as the amazing organization from the club!
