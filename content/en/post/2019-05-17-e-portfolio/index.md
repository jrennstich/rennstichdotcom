E-portfolios are increasingly becoming popular tools for effective and reflective online or blended learning-based teaching approaches. Not only do they allow students to develop **and** also critically reflect on their own skill level and skill set they have garnered during a course; they also allow them to develop important digital skills while doing so.

To make life easier for instructors looking for a way to implement e-portfolios into their own offerings, I have made available some materials (introductory text to explain students the whole concept, a grading rubric, links to some of the involved technology) on [OSF](https://osf.io/x6bn8/?view_only=4efa533d937c4fc88ea94a613182b2bc). The catch? It's all in German ;-)

You speak German? Then you find alles Weitere [hier](https://osf.io/x6bn8/?view_only=4efa533d937c4fc88ea94a613182b2bc).
