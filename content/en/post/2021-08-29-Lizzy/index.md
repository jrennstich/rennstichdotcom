> But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee;    
and the fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee:    
Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee:    
and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee.    
Who knoweth not in all these    
that the hand of the LORD hath wrought this?    
In whose hand is the soul of every living thing,    
and the breath of all mankind.    
         ---Job 12:7-10 (KJV)

After 14 years, Lizzy, my partner in crime, personal coach, therapist, and research partner (soothing snores, mostly) all of a sudden yesterday had a stroke while we were in the woods and passed away in my arms.

It really hurts. I miss her so much.
