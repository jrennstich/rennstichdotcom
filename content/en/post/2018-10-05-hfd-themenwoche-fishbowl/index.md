The [HFD (German Forum for Higher Education in the Digital Age)](https://hochschulforumdigitalisierung.de/en/about/hochschulforum-digitalisierung) hosted its second conference week in Berlin and I attended the Hochschulforum Digitalisierung (HFD) Themenwoche/conference ["Shaping the Digital Turn"](https://hochschulforumdigitalisierung.de/en/hfd-conference-week-2018-registration) for a session on Data Literacy Education on 28 Sep 2018 at the Allianz Forum Berlin for the "Future Skills Day". During this final session of the conference the most promising universities applying for grants in the Data Literacy Education program presented themselves in a public jury meeting during this event (with a final selection of for proposals). As a joint program of civil society and the business community, the Stifterverband's "Future Skills Initiative" is designed to improve the conditions for acquiring digital and other relevant skills for the future.

I used the chance during the fishbowl session to [throw in my two cents, starting at 19:00](https://youtu.be/usgwySTGi-o?t=1140).
