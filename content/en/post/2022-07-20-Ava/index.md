The wait is over - finally, there will be a new dog in my life again! Ava vom Mecklenburgischen, a German shorthaired pointer [(Deutsch-Kurzhaar)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Shorthaired_Pointer), will be joining me in Kassel starting August this year. This is the first dog I will be able to train - so that's gonna be a new and excting new learning experience for both, hound and man... Very, very excited about this, needless to say.
