## The Challenge

Data collection has become an integral part of every major NGO engaged in active campaigns to justify the directed use of resources and monitoring of their activities to a growing number of stakeholders, including but not limited to outside funders, governments and other partners. It is also driven by an increasing need for transparency in activities conducted in a dialog with the public at large. As the world's largest youth organization operating in 119 countries, the [World YMCA](http://www.ymca.int) is characterized by a very heterogenous membership structure in terms of resources, capabilities and institutional capacity of each of its members (national movements). This diversity continues within the individual national YMCAs. The organization faces a core challenge to collect consistent and high-quality data across multiple organizational levels and members to provide an empirical basis for impact assessments, project and process evaluations, and other uses of empirical data for strategic decision-making and data-driven management. It further is challenged to move from established paper-based to digital forms of data-collection and by general resource constraints to justify the previously high costs of quality data collection and analysis.

## Project Goals

The project aims to:

- Develop a **basic common data-framework** for all its members for monitoring, impact assessment, evaluation, and controlling purposes.
- Develop a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org) hardware-based, rugged and low-cost **mobile data-collection and e-learning serverbox (MODE)** that serves both, as a mobile training and data-collection hub **providing wireless access to mobile phones** and access to an **e-learning platform and data-depository** through a local wireless network with no need for constant and high-speed internet access.
- Enable **young people to participate** in the data-collection effort and **develop critical basic digital and data-literacy skills** through e-learning tools hosted by the databox.
- Establish a **basic data analysis solution** suitable for different audiences across the multiple organizational levels.
- **Design** the tools **together with stakeholders at all stages** of the project.
- Design the system based on **open standards** to ensure the ability to cooperate with a large set of stakeholders and partners.


## The Timeline

The project is currently under review for funding.
