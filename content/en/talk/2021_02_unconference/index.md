# About the conference

The 2021 unconference will feature participant-led sessions analyzing the current state of open scholarship practice and interactive hackathons seeking solutions to identified problems. Participants will assess barriers to adoption of open scholarship practices unique to the education community and brainstorm strategies for promoting greater awareness.

Registration for the unconference is free and no previous experience with unconferences or hackathons is required to participate. Don't miss the opportunity to be a part of this field-leading conversation to address unique barriers to adoption for education research.

The unconference will include engaging plenary sessions to orient attendees to open scholarship and introduce tools and best practices for open research in education. Deep dives into key principles of open scholarship will provide detailed guidance for education researchers.
