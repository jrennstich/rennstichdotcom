## About the book
Providing a unique, empirically based perspective on the past and future development of globalization as a long-term process emerging in different parts of the world, this book puts current changes in a historical context in a systematic fashion, unpacking the global political, economic, social, and cultural implications of this change. It traces the resemblance of past commercial networks with emerging digital networks and contrasts them with industrial production systems.

### Globalization re-contextualized
This book offers a unique perspective on current social changes changes on a global scale. Describing globalization as a long-term process of intertwined technological, economic, political, and cultural changes, the author identifies distinct phases in the global system development, and concludes that the pattern of change continues even with the rise of new digital technologies.

### World system development as a complex system
_Making of a Digital World_ develops a model of world system development as a complex adaptive social system that takes into account past historical trajectories as well as possible new developments with a special focus on the rise of the digital infosphere as a new global "space domain."
