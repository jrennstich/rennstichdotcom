## Textbook Project

Textbook with additional interactive digital/blended-learning units for integration into LMS systems. Based on case-vignettes connecting the covered theoretical material to realistic scenarios found in varied workplace and educational settings, the book helps learners to gain and assess their mastery of critical ethical digital and data literacy competences. Instructors benefit from the availability of regularly updated study-material that can easily be imported into any LMS system such as Moodle, Canvas, or ILIAS.

## Project Goals
